This my last project for the subject of "Creative Coding" from the Bachelor in Digital Interaction and Multimedia Techniques at Open University of Catalonia (UOC).
It's been coded with Processing and you can check the video here: https://youtu.be/gwsUzihk6j0
The background music was originally composed by Joan Pere Jove for this videogame.

Enjoy!
